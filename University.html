                                    <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
                                    until
                                    the
                                    collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
                                    These
                                    classes
                                    d the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions.
                                    You
                                    can
                                    modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also
                                    worth
                                    noting
                                    that
                                    just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                                    transition
                                    does
                                    limit
                                    overflow.
