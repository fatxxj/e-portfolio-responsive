                Undergraduate studies on behalf of the study program of FINKI aim to provide top engineering staff
                to meet the growing demand for computer engineers. Students in this study program gain knowledge
                that provides them with great professional flexibility and a wide selection of jobs wherever there
                is a need to design, implement and maintain computer systems. The graduate engineer of this profile
                can
                build his career in industry, in the public and service sector, but, especially in the companies for
                development of computer systems, systems that need to work in real time, systems for support
                of telecommunication services, services based on Internet, advanced user interfaces, application
                solutions related to the design and implementation of computer systems and more.
